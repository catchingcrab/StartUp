C++ interview Question

what is lamda function, give me an example

can virtual function be inline?

what is explicit inline function

virtual constructor? why not
cant delegated to any other object for creating an instance

virtual destructor
yes, should alway if you do inheritance and has at least v func

diff bt copy copy constr and assign operator
one new inst and the other just copy val to exist
A(const A& the_other)
A& operator =(const A& the_other){ }

shallow copy and deep copy

do I need to explicit to call destructor
NO.

when copy cstr called
pass by v, return by val, construct by another obj, compiler need to temp obj

conversion construct
single arg

conversion operator
public meth for specific data conv
operator double(){ return -val};
...
Boo obj;
double i = Obj;

can copy cstr accept obj not a ref?
No. must be a const ref.  otherwise its error, because its not know how to copy yet.

order of obj be destructed:
first constructed, last destroyed. reversed order
exaple array

overload a destruct?
NO. one for each class. never take parameter

can throw excep in destruct?
NO. stack unwinding ( stack fram popped)

place new?
char memory[100];
void *place = memory;
Fred *f  = new(place) Fred();
//the place and f will be equal
f->~Fred();

derived class explicitly call base cstr's destructor?
No. deriv call base destr first then ..., reversed order

List x and List x()
class and a func return a List obj

can one cstr call another cstr of the class
No ( maybe yes in new version)
combine code with a init()?


how to link a c++ prog to C function
extern "C"
extern 'C" int func(int*, Foo)
turn off mangling

operators cant overload:
sizeof()   .  .*   .-> ::  ?:
